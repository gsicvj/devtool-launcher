# devtool-launcher
A python-kivy launcher for developer tools.

CONTAINS:
- dev_launcher.py (MAIN script)
- tool_info.json (TOOL source - at this point, you have to write your tools here)
- devlauncher/* (import classes)

TODO:
- add tab for adding, deleting and editing TOOLS (instead of writing to tool_info.json file)
- add tab for creating different types of projects (ie. one could use different tools for web development, mobile apps ...)
